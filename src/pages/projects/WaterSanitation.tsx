							It is estimated that Tanzania spends 70 per cent of
							its health budget on preventable WASH-related
							diseases as the majority of the population does not
							have access to improved sanitation, and close to
							half of the population does not have access to clean
							drinking water. In Tanzania, WASH-sensitive
							indicators such as diarrhea and stunting are high.

							Without adequate WASH facilities, living and working
							premises become breeding grounds for diseases that
							kill children and threaten their ability to grow.
							Girls, children with disabilities and children
							living in rural areas are most affected. This
							further heightens inequities and uneven
							opportunities for development. As part of its Vision
							2025, the Government of Tanzania has pledged to
							increase access to improved sanitation to 95 per
							cent by 2025. The Second Five Year Development Plan
							(FYDP II) has also set the target for access to
							improved sanitation facilities at 85 per cent in
